<head><h3>CLOUD COMPUTING</h3></head>
<p>The purpose of writing this report is to outline what cloud computing is, its purposes, how it is used and
so on and so on. The importance of this report is to make things easier for the people that do not
understand the new way of doing things. To give them a better understanding of cloud computing.
Cloud computing is whereby information technology is transformed. While the information and
processes are being moved to the cloud, it is changing not only where computing is concerned but also
fully how it is done. In the past, there were programs that were installed locally but now there is a use of
cloud computing which is simpler and provides more money. Many people have not stopped to use the
programs that were installed locally but the interest of cloud computing seems to be increasing.</p>
<p>The cloud services have two main characteristics: service abstraction levels (PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS) along
with deployment models (community, public, private and hybrid clouds). The first one which is private,
this is whereby someone hosts all his or her computing infrastructure himself or herself and is not
shared. The security and control level are at highest when using a private network. The second one
which is community, community cloud is shared between organizations with a common goal or that fit
into a specific community. The third one which is public, the whole computing infrastructure is located
on the premises of a cloud computing company that offers the cloud service. The last one which is
hybrid uses both private and public clouds depending on their purpose. You host your most important
applications on your own servers to keep them more secure.</p>
<p>There are many different things that revolve around cloud computing this is a clear indication that cloud
computing is demanded in bulks. Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system
resources especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active
management by the user. In the picture above there is a clear indication of cloud computing. As stated
above that there are many things that revolve around cloud computing. Phones, tablets, laptops,
servers, desktops and so on. All these devices mentioned are the result of cloud computing, if it were
not for cloud computing, almost everyone would be still using the old locally programs that take time
and required more costs.</p>
<p>Cloud computing has become the ideal way to deliver enterprise applications and the preferred solution
for companies extending their infrastructure or launching new innovations. Cloud computing has two
meanings. The most common refers to running workloads remotely over the internet in a commercial
provider’s data center, also known as the “public cloud” mode. All in all, cloud computing was made to
make lives easier and more enjoyable. If someone were to undo the presence of cloud computing many
things in life would be less enjoyable and exciting because there would be no presence of phones,
laptops, desktops, servers, and tablets.</p>
<p>Cloud computing consists of five major properties rapid elasticity, on-demand self-service, measured
service, broad network access, and resource pooling or shared services. All these properties are required
to remain existing for a service to succeed as a cloud service. All the deployment models and abstraction
levels consume in mutual these five possessions of cloud computing. Firstly, looking at abstraction levels
service models can be viewed in terms of increased levels of abstraction. As you move up in the picture
below you gain the highest form of abstraction at the business process-as-a-service which is level 5.</p>
<p>Deployment models as stated overhead have four parts: public, private, community and hybrid. Each
deployment models have its own abstraction level that defines it. If public cloud has abstraction level of
SaaS that can be defined as SaaS public cloud. If private cloud has abstraction level of PaaS that can be
described as PaaS private cloud. If community cloud has abstraction level of IaaS that can be described
as IaaS community cloud. Coming to hybrid, it is encapsulation of two or more cloud deployment models
that has its own unique characteristics. This picture gives a clear indication of what is happening in
hybrid cloud. But there are different combinations of hybrid cloud, it is not only the combination of
private and public cloud. There are also combinations: private and private; public and public;
community, public and private; as well as community, public, private and hybrid.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is deeper. It is not only about knowing devices, but it is about knowing the whole
theory about cloud computing. It is about understanding the functioning of devices. For an individual to
know more about cloud computing that individual needs to have one of the devices that operate under
the influence of cloud computing. The more someone knows more about cloud computing, the easier it
gets. It does not benefit much to know how to operate a device if that does not know the operation of
that device. As stated, that cloud computing is deeper there more things to be understood in order so
that it can make sense.</p>
<p>There are different types of cloud. Clouds can take the form of any deployment model. There is personal
cloud, cloud of things, cloud relationships, encapsulation, aggregation, composition, federation, and
cloud cells. Each of these clouds has a connection with the major clouds. An example will be a personal
cloud. This cloud is defined by its scope rather than whether it is available on a shared basis. This cloud’s
scope is a person or a single entity, and that it can be a private, public or hybrid cloud. Example of public
personal cloud is iCloud. The example of private personal cloud is a network attached storage.</p>
<p>Cloud of things have inanimate objects, or things, as its scope; that is, it is a cloud that works with things
instead of people or organizations. Encapsulation is when an object consists of another object.
Aggregation is applicable to any cloud abstraction type. Composition is when a cloud is being composed
of one or more distinct clouds. Federation is a special type of composition. Cloud cell is a cloud that
provides a distinct, fundamental, function or service. Cloud computing has become a great solution for
providing a flexible, on-demand, and dynamically scalable computing infrastructure for many
applications. Cloud computing infrastructure allows the businesses to lower the costs by outsourcing
computations on-demand.</p>
<p>Looking at the cloud computing delivery models and services. The software as a service cloud
infrastructure only runs applications developed by the service provider. The platform as a service offers
the capability to deploy consumer-created or acquired applications using programming languages and
tools supported by the provider. An infrastructure as a service has the capability to provision processing,
storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources, the consumer can deploy and run
arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The database is a cloud
service where the database runs on the service provider’s physical infrastructure. A cloud database
services offers distinct advantages: instantaneous scalability, performance guarantees, specialized
expertise, and latest technology.</p>
<p>Cloud computing provides an easy way to access servers, storage, databases, and a full range of
application services over the internet. Cloud providers operate and manage the network-attached
hardware needed for these applications services, providing, and using the resources you need through a
web application. The cloud has become a technology that influences everyone’s daily life. The adoption
of solutions and services in the cloud present a few of advantages and benefits, among others: speed
and agility, flexible capacity, go for variable costs rather than investment costs and no more costs for
operating and maintaining data centers. Cloud computing is the most cost-efficient method to use,
maintain and upgrade.</p>
<p>Cloud computing provides with an infinite storing. The data stored in the cloud provides infinite storing
size. It is responsible for backing up all the stored data and the cloud and restoring. Cloud computing
provides with an automatic software integration, this means that cloud operators do not have to take
more energies to modify and mix their requests as for every individual favorites. Cloud computing
makes thinkable innovative programs of requests and transmissions of innovative skills that are
collaborative in nature. It makes it simpler for businesses to measure their provision conferring to the
request of regulars. Lastly, cloud provides the advantage of quick deployment.</p>
<p>The main risks involved in cloud computing are technical issues, though it is true that information and
data on the cloud can be accessed anytime and from anywhere, there remain moments when the
system can have some serious malfunction. It can also be security in the cloud. Loading data in the cloud
can make the businesses be the easy targets when it comes to external hack attacks and threats. At
opening, a cloud computing might seem to be a lot inexpensive than a software solution connected and
track in-line, but the truth is, the installation of cloud computing is expensive. Another disadvantage is
flexibility. And lastly, absence of care, Anita Campbell (OPEN Forum) pens, “Customer service for Web
apps leaves a lot to be desired – all too many cloud-based applications make it difficult to get customer
service promptly – or at all. Sending an email and hoping for a response within 24 hours is not an
acceptable way for most of us to run a business”.</p>
<p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offers IT infrastructure such as storage, server, network plus so on as a
service. Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an integrated platform as a service for users to develop
and manage necessary software. Software as a Service (SaaS) provides services to lease and use various
software and applications on various web browsers after purchasing. Database as a Service (DBaaS) this
is where the database runs on the service provider’s physical infrastructure. Cloud computing services
can be referred as the cloud service tier.</p>
<p>There are entities involved in cloud computing such as, service consumer this entity maintains a
business relationship with, and uses service from, service providers. Service provider is responsible for
making a service available to service consumers. Carrier is the intermediary that provides connectivity
and transport of cloud services between providers and consumers. Broker is an entity that controls the
use, performance and delivery of cloud services and negotiates relationships between providers and 
consumers. Auditor is a party that can conduct independent assessment of cloud services, information
system operations, performance, and security of the cloud implementation.</p>
<p>Private cloud providing services exclusively within a firewall with strong security features, enhanced
security and privacy compared to a public cloud. Public cloud, there is no limit to the use of cloud
services. Services with a structure to pay based on usage. Hybrid cloud, this is the combination of public
and private cloud and interoperability. Community cloud in this cloud the infrastructure is shared by
several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns. It may be managed
by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises. Cloud computing
deployment models can also be called cloud service adoption methods.</p>
<p>Cloud computing depend on virtualization expertise. Here are two rudimentary kinds of virtualization:
server virtualization and application virtualization. Application virtualization brings a request that is held
on a solitary engine towards many operators. The request can be placed in the cloud on extraordinaryscore virtual machines but since many operators contact it, its prices are joint by those operators. This
makes the request inexpensive to transport to the close operator. The end operator ensures non need
to consume extreme-score hardware to track the request; a classy engine, such as a low—finish
workplace or a thin-user lethal, will be sufficient. If the information used by the simulated claim are kept
in the cloud, the operator is not tied to someone ruse or setting to use the request or entree its
information.</p>
<p>Server virtualization practices mutual bodily hardware (computing machines, networks, or storage) to
crowd practical machineries. A bodily crowd mechanism can take any figure of practical machineries
running on it so that one usual of hardware is used to track dissimilar machineries. Practical
technologies can be fixed by their personal working scheme plus their personal unlike set of requests;
the working schemes or requests do not require to be the similar across the simulated gears. Server
virtualization has a main price profit: it permits an individual to combine several bodily gears on less
bodily machineries that crowd the practical machineries. This rise in calculating competence grades in
inferior planetary, care, chilling, and energy charges, also the clear discount inn obtaining charges for
the gears. An extra use is that less bodily machineries and inferior power bills interpret to setting
openness.</p>
<p>This characteristic of cloud computing is also referred as on-demand availability and has aim of
empowering a consumer to consume the service whenever he or she wants. This characteristic of cloud
computing also has its own two characteristics. Those characteristics are as follows: the service will be
available to an individual even when that individual is not using it so that it will be ready for that
individual to use when an individual request it (thus the up-time of the cloud computing services has to
be very good), and the service remains available while an individual is using it (thus an individual’s user
experience should not be impaired even if there may be an upsurge in the number of users).</p>
<p>Cloud storage has enticed a lot of study in new months. There are five concerns with cloud data storage.
The first concern is the doubt that the cloud is safe, how was Apple’s iCloud chopped? Later the fineexposed bout on Apple’s iCloud, surveys exposed a direct drop in the approval of cloud storage.
Operators informed that sense weaker and began curious about the safety of their individual private
information. The vital division that the common media not ever made was that the cloud was not
chopped. The break was an effect of exposures in Apple’s code word safety scheme, allowing insistent
hackers to conjecture the code words plus safety queries of choice operators.</p>
<p>The second concern is that in what way is the cloud safe? To save information safe, the visible mark of
guard for any cloud scheme is encryption. Encryption devices use complex systems to hide cloud-safe
data. To decode coded records, would-be hackers would essential the encryption key. Though coded
data is not 100% uncrackable, decoding needs a vast quantity of processer dispensation control,
scientific software, and a lot of period. An individual must make certain that he or she saves his or her
information harmless by securing it up in a method that will not be so calm for other individuals to track.
The third concern is that what can an individual do to help his or her cloud data safe? Well people that
work with cloud computing have mentioned that it is a user’s responsibility to keep his or her data
secured as well as an individual’s cloud provider’s responsibility. To retain your code word safe, contain
using the similar code word many platforms; increase literatures, figures and signs to his or her code
word, and do not exploit a code word that is in any method linked to his or her private life. Information
safety is a biggest fear, even though choices are now partial, they exist. The main cause of concern is
data being lost rather than cloud storage being hacked.</p>
<p>The fourth concern is that is cloud storage reliable? In some cases, or situations, cloud storage can be
reliable but in other situations it is not reliable. For instance, cloud storage can keep data safe which
show that it can be reliable in some cases. Cloud computing can be weak in the logic that it is in the
pointers of the third-party scheme. Cloud storage is extra consistent when used in cycle with another
storage scheme, such as Google Drive. By pleasing joint documentations and loading them into
something like Google Drive, an individual can simply find it over the other platform. Services like
cloudHQ offer unified integration via the cloud and Google apps, Box, and Dropbox; making it
unbearable to misplace your records.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a concern that who is presently using cloud storage. A new election detailed that 86% of
businesses not lone usage wide cloud storage schemes, but many cloud storage schemes. The review
contained businesses from 80 changed countries and composed information from as far away as 2005,
earlier cloud storage developed a hot control matter. Maximum businesses either trust cloud storage
sufficient to contain it tellingly in their information storage vitalities, or that the profits of cloud can
boost the operation of their companies. Cloud practice has undergone an exponential increase all year
since 2009.What is discovered is that cloud computing is really used but people use it not knowing that it is cloud
computing. There is an encouragement to people that have not switched to cloud computing, because it
is advantageous to use it. Even though it is not 100% accurate but it is worth a try. It helps to prevent
many bad things and helps a device, laptop, desktop, and many more to operate fully and well. Cloud
computing is highly recommended, and it is highly safe to use it.</p><br/>
